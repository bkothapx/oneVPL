# `hello-createsession` Sample

This sample shows how to use the oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) to
initialize a session using 1.x common APIs or 2.x enhanced programming model APIs.

| Optimized for    | Description
|----------------- | ----------------------------------------
| OS               | Ubuntu* 20.04; Windows* 10
| Hardware         | Intel速 Processor Graphics GEN9 or newer
| Software         | Intel速 oneAPI Video Processing Library(oneVPL)
| What You Will Learn | How to use oneVPL sessions
| Time to Complete | 5 minutes


## Purpose

This sample is a command line application that initializes a session.  This is a
hello world case to showcase oneVPL architecture.

## Building the `hello-createsession` Program

### On a Linux* System

Perform the following steps:

1. Install the prerequisite software. To build and run the sample you need to
   install prerequisite software and set up your environment:

   - Intel速 oneAPI Base Toolkit for Linux*
   - [CMake](https://cmake.org)

2. Set up your environment using the following command.
   ```
   source <oneapi_install_dir>/setvars.sh
   ```
   Here `<oneapi_install_dir>` represents the root folder of your oneAPI
   installation, which is `/opt/intel/oneapi/` when installed as root, and
   `~/intel/oneapi/` when installed as a normal user.  If you customized the
   installation folder, it is in your custom location.

3. Build the program using the following commands:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Run the program using the following command:
   ```
   cmake --build . --target run
   ```


### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer

#### Building the program using CMake

1. Install the prerequisite software. To build and run the sample you need to
   install prerequisite software and set up your environment:

   - Intel速 oneAPI Base Toolkit for Windows*
   - [CMake](https://cmake.org)

2. Set up your environment using the following command.
   ```
   <oneapi_install_dir>\setvars.bat
   ```
   Here `<oneapi_install_dir>` represents the root folder of your oneAPI
   installation, which is which is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\`
   when installed using default options. If you customized the installation
   folder, the `setvars.bat` is in your custom location.  Note that if a
   compiler is not part of your oneAPI installation you should run in a Visual
   Studio 64-bit command prompt.

3. Build the program using the following commands:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Run the program using the following command:
   ```
   cmake --build . --target run
   ```
